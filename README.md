### Usage

After install this package you will get two components: `Sticky` and `StickyElement`.

* `Sticky` component works exactly as a Scroll interactive component.
* `StickyElement` must be connected to any frame that you want to be sticky.

> The `StickyElement` is treated as relative positioned until the scroll vertical position
crosses the element top position, at which point it is treated as fixed positioned.

### Handle status

`StickyElement` accepts two component instances:

* `Content`: the default element that will show when is pinned or not.
* `Pinned` (optional): a component to render when the element is fixed positioned.

In other complex scenarios, if you connect a `StickyElement` to a code component,
when its position is fixed, your code component will receive a `stucked` property.

The package includes a `Header` code component that works with stucked state:

```jsx
export function Header(props) {
    return (
        <Frame>
            {props.stucked ? "Pinned" : "Unpinned"}
        </Frame>
    )
}
```

This is useful, for example, if you want to perform an animation between the two states.


#### ⚠️ Important

Frames in Framer X sometimes doesn't has a top value, this happen because the element has
**Pin bottom** alignment on canvas. In that case, the component will calculate the top
position based on his height and bottom position and also from parents layout values.
It's recomendable to change `StickyElement` and parents frames alignment to **Pin top**,
it's more efficient and will work correctly.

**Notes:**

* You can set a `offset` parameter to each sticky element.
* You can set multiple `StickyElement` within scroll content frame.
* It works with `StickyElement` nested on other elements.
* It only works for vertical scroll.
